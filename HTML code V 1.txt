            <h3 class="sub-header">Frequency of Maintenance</h3>
            <p class="aquarium">It is neither practical nor healthy to clean every surface in the aquarium on a daily or
                even weekly basis. For that matter, it's never wise to clean everything in the aquarium at the same
                time. To minimize the impact cleaning has on beneficial bacteria, cleaning of colony-rich areas, such as
                the filter and the substrate, should be staggered. If the bacterial colonies are disturbed too much, it
                can disrupt the nitrogen cycle enough to cause a spike in ammonia and nitrite.2 For that reason, it's
                also wise to test the water a few days after a significant cleaning to ensure nothing is amiss.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-header">Daily</h3>
            <p class="aquarium">Do a quick visual check of the aquarium to ensure the filter is running at full
                strength, the lights are functioning properly, and any other equipment you have is running normally.
                Check the water temperature to ensure it's in the proper range. Count the fish and check if they appear
                healthy. A good time to do this is when you feed them, as they will be out and easy to observe. Once
                they have finished eating, examine the tank to see if there is uneaten food remaining on the bottom. If
                you notice that there is often uneaten food left after five to 10 minutes, cut back on the volume of
                food you give your fish at each feeding. Should you notice that uneaten food starts building up on the
                bottom of the tank, use a siphon or gravel vacuum to remove it. If the water level has dropped, top it
                off with treated or aged water as needed.
                This is a good time to start an aquarium journal or log if you haven't done so already. While there is
                no need to record everything, it is helpful to note anything out of the ordinary on your daily checks.
                That way you can catch trends that may be occurring. For instance, the temperature dropping by a degree
                isn't a huge deal, but if it drops a degree four days in a row, that's a tip-off that something may be
                wrong with your heater. All of this can be done in literally a matter of minutes, so it's not a huge
                time investment.</p>

            <h3 class="sub-header">Cayman islands</h3>
            <p class="travel">The Cayman Islands, a British Overseas Territory, encompasses 3 islands in the western
                Caribbean Sea. Grand Cayman, the largest island, is known for its beach resorts and varied scuba diving
                and snorkelling sites. Cayman Brac is a popular launch point for deep-sea fishing excursions. Little
                Cayman, the smallest island, is home to diverse wildlife, from endangered iguanas to seabirds such as
                red-footed boobies</p>
            <blockquote class="travel">"I talk to nurses and programmers, salespeople and firefighters - people who bust
                their tails every day. Not one of them - not one - stashes their money in the Cayman Islands to avoid
                paying their fair share of taxes." ~ Elizabeth Warren</blockquote>
            <q class="travel">"Do away with the corporate loopholes that allow major profitable corporations to stash
                their money in the Cayman Islands and not pay a nickel in some cases in federal income taxes." ~
